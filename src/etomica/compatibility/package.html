Provides infrastructure that enables classes to specify restrictions on their use with
other classes.  Permits, for example, a hard-potential integrator to specify that it 
cannot function with a soft potential.  This capability is used by the etomica IDE 
to discover incompatibilities between classes, so that it can better guide the 
user in making choices.

This package is in the early stages of development, and is subject to substantial modification.
