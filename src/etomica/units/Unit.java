/**
 * Interface used to specify the physical units to be used when inputting or
 * outputting a quantity. All internal calculations are performed using
 * simulation units, which are all derived from the picosecond, Dalton, and
 * Angstrom.  Classes implementing this interface convert the simulation units
 * to a more common unit for interfacing with the user.
 * <br>
 * I/O classes (normally Device and Display) have associated with them a
 * class that implements the Unit interface.  In addition to providing
 * conversions, the unit class also provides textual labels that can be used by
 * a Device or Display to indicate the units is it using.
