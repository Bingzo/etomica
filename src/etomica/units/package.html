Defines units and dimensions that are used for conversions during input or output.  All quantities
used internally by the simulation are given in "simulation units", which is based on the
Angstrom as the unit of length, the Dalton as the unit of mass, and the picosecond as the unit
of time (a Dalton, or atomic mass unit (amu), is one gram divided by Avogadro's number).  The
classes given in this package can be used to convert between these units and another unit
that might be more natural or convenient.
The two key elements of the package are the Unit interface and the abstract Dimension class.  

<h3>Dimension</h3>
Instances of Dimension can be used to indicate the physical nature of a value, e.g., whether 
it is a quantity of mass, length, force, etc.  There are two places where this information is
routinely provided:
<ul>
<li>the package {@link etomica.data etomica.data} defines a Data class
which holds a DataInfo instance describing the Data; part of the information given in DataInfo
is a Dimension instance which specifies the physical dimensions of the data. 
<li>the convention
of defining set/get methods to access and change fields of an object is extended to include
a method that provides a Dimension instance appropriate to the field.  For example, a class
that defines setSize and getSize methods to access the field <i>size</i> 
(which represents, say, the diameter of a sphere) will also have a method named 
getSizeDimension which returns an instance of Dimension indicating dimensions of length.
</ul>
Dimensions are specified via a <i>signature</i>, which is an array of seven values indicating the
exponents of the fundamental dimensions that are combined to form the specified dimension.
The fundamental dimensions follow the convention defined by the 
<a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/si/">SI system</a>, and are
<ul>
<li>length
<li>mass
<li>time
<li>electric current
<li>temperature
<li>number (of molecules)
<li>luminous intensity
</ul>
So, for example, the signature
of the energy dimension is length<sup>2</sup>-mass/time<sup>2</sup> and is given by the signature array (2, 1, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0).
The signature of energy/molecules (e.g., Joules/mole) is (2, 1, -2, 0, 0, -1, 0).
<p>
Dimension subclasses are defined for the fundamental dimensions and commonly encountered derived dimensions.
These classes have names such as Length, Time, Volume, Energy, and so on.  These classes all define
static singleton instances with the field name DIMENSION; the field SIM_UNIT in each class gives an
instance of Unit that corresponds to the unit derived from simulation units for that dimension.
Other dimensions can be defined by constructing instances of CompoundDimension.

<h3>Unit</h3>
Implementations of the Unit interface provide a convenient means to convert between 
simulation units and some other particular unit, which need be done only when data is 
read, written, or displayed.  
<p>
SimpleUnit is a basic class that holds a conversion factor,
a Dimension instance and other descriptive information for implementing a basic Unit.  Many
specific units are defined by extending this class; examples include Kelvin, Bar, Joule, etc.
<p>
A PrefixedUnit class takes a Unit instance and a Prefix, which can be used to construct
units such as kilograms (combining Prefix.KILO with Gram.UNIT). 
<p>
Derived units that are not already defined can be constructed using the CompoundUnit class.
<p>
The package {@link etomica.units.systems etomica.units.systems} defines constructs that
can collect the units defined by conventional unit systems, such as SI, cgs, English, etc.
