Provides classes for specifying the arrangement of atoms and molecules in space.  Two general categories
of classes are defined: 
<ul>
<li>classes extending <@link etomica.config.Configuration Configuration> define
arrangements of molecules a Box.  A Configuration acts on all molecules in the box,
and their placement takes into account the dimensions of the Box's Boundary.
<li>classes extending <@link etomica.config.Conformation Conformation> define arrangements
of Atoms in an atom group. These classes act on the atoms in an AtomList, and they put the
atoms in some specified arrangement that typically is centered on or near the origin.
</ul>
Each AtomFactory holds a Conformation class that it uses to place in a standard arrangement
the Atoms in the atom group it builds.
<p>
The molecules initially populating a Box have the coordinates given to them by their AtomFactory.
Thus most molecules initially lie on top of one another.  A Configuration must be instantiated and 
applied (using its <tt>initializeCoordinates</tt> method) to the Box before simulation commences.
