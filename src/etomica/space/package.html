Specifies abstract classes and interfaces that define the nature of the physical space in which
a simulation is performed.  Implementations are given in the packages {@link etomica.space3d etomica.space3d},
{@link etomica.space2d etomica.space2d}, and {@link etomica.space1d etomica.space1d}, for 3-, 2-, and 1-dimensional
spaces, respectively.  The key elements are:
<ul>
<li>Space, which serves primarily as a factory for the other classes.  Subclasses of Space make vectors, etc.
appropriate to the space it represents.
<li>Vector, which for a D-dimensional space is a set of D fields of type double, with methods used the
perform vector operations on them.
<li>Tensor, which defines a 2nd-rank tensor in the D-dimensional space.  It hold D^2 fields of type double, and
defines methods used to perform tensor operations on them.
<li>Orientation, which provides fields and operations define and manipulate the orientation of a rigid body.
<li>Boundary, which is held by a Box instance to define the size of the space and to specify what
happens as atoms cross the boundary of the space (e.g., periodic boundaries).
</ul>
All of the classes above (except perhaps Boundary) are implemented in the space subpackages in a manner
specific to the space being defined.  Additionally, this package defines several Coordinate interface, classes
and factories that don't require spatially-dependent implementations (instead they are formed from fields
that are specific to the space).  Coordinates may be just a position/orientation, or additionally
include momentum components.  An instance of Coordinate is held by every Atom.
<p>
Coordinate interfaces are named beginning with "I", and indicate the number and type of fields as follows
<ul>
<li><code>ICoordinate</code> has just a vector position
<li><code>ICoordinateAngular</code> has just a vector orientation
<li><code>IcoordinateKinetic</code> has a vector position and vector velocity
<li><code>IcoordinateAngularKinetic</code> has position, orientation, and velocities for each
</ul>
Implementations of these interfaces are given in the like-named classes obtained by removing the initial "I".
<p>
CoordinateFactory classes make each type of coordinate, using vectors, etc. made from a given Space.
The coordinate factory is used by an {@link etomica.atom.AtomFactory AtomFactory} to give each
constructed Atom its Coordinate instance.
<p>
The CoordinatePair class is an important tool for classes that perform calculations based on pairs of atoms.
