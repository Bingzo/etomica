/**
 * Basis that helps construct a beta-tin crystal.  
 * 
 * The beta-tin box of tin has the beta-tin crystal structure, designated 
 * by the Pearson symbol tI4 (ASM Handbook).  The "t" indicates that the structure 
 * belongs to the tetragonal crystal system.  The "I" indicates that the space 
 * lattice, or lattice type, is body-centered (There is an atom at the center 
 * of the unit cell).  The "4" indicates that there are four atoms per unit 
 * cell.  An eighth of an atom is at each of the eight corners, one atom is 
 * at the center, and half of an atom is at each of the four a*c faces.  
 * Note:  These atoms are NOT centered in the a*c faces.  There is not an 
 * atom in either of the a*a faces. The Strukturbericht symbol of the beta-Sn 
 * crystal structure is A5.  A good visualization of the structure is available 
 * at http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil .
 * 
 * Each atom is at the center of a distorted octahedron.  Consider the atom 
 * at the center of a unit cell.  The two tips of its octahedron (the top and
 * bottom of the two joined pyramids, if you will) are formed by
 * the atoms at the centers of the unit cells directly above and below the atom 
 * of interest's unit cell.  The four corners of what would be the pyriamids'
 * bases are formed by the atoms in the a*c faces of the center atom's unit cell.
 * The center atom is slightly closer to these four atoms than it is to the two 
 * atoms forming the tips of the octahedron.  The first-nearest-neighbor 
 * distance for beta-Sn is 3.02 Angstroms (ASM Handbook), while the second-
 * nearest-neighbor distance is c (3.1815 Angstroms).  After doing a little 
 * math, one will find that two of the four atoms in the a*c faces are each 
 * 1/4*c below the center of their faces, and the other two are 1/4*c above the 
 * center of their faces.
 * 
 * It should be noted that the beta-tin structure is not specific to the element tin.
 * Silicon, germanium and tin have several solid boxs, and each experience the 
 * diamond-cubic crystal structure and the beta-tin crystal structure (Mujica,
 * Rubio, Munoz, and Needs, 2003). The diamond crystal structure for tin is 
 * often refered to as the alpha-tin box (gray tin).
 * 
 * This class uses the primitive vectors as given in PrimitiveTetragonal.java.
 * 
 * This class was adapted from D.A. Kofke's BasisCubic.java by K.R. Schadel and A. 
 * Schultz July 2005.
