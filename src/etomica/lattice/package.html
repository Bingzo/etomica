Provides classes for defining regular arrays of objects (sites), typically points in space.  The
AbstractLattice is the key interface in the package; it associates an Object with an
array of integers (or index).  The number integers in the array needed to specify a site
defines the dimension of the lattice.
<p>
Implementation of SpaceLattice indicates that the lattice objects
are points in space (instances of etomica.space.Vector), while BravaisLattice is an
implementation of SpaceLattice that defines the points in terms of a set of primitive
vectors (defined by the Primitive class).  A Crystal is a BravaisLattice with an
associated Basis, which can be used to define a molecular crystal, or (using LatticeCrystal) 
as an alternative representation of other lattices (e.g., an fcc lattice as cubic primitive with four
basis points, versus as an fcc primitive with one basis point).
<p>
RectangularLattice is a generic, arbitrary-dimension implementation of AbstractLattice that
defines the lattice over a rectangular set of index values (i.e., the range of each index element 
is finite and independent of the other index element values).
<p>
Several iterators (implementing IndexIterator) are defined for generating index arrays to 
enumerate the sites of the lattice.
