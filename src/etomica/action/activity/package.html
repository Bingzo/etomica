Collects classes that extend  etomica.action.Activity, which implements Action 
and is an abstract class appropriate to encapsulate complex, time-consuming tasks.  
Unlike a simple {@link etomica.action.Action Action}, an {@link etomica.action.Activity Activity} can be paused
or even halted prematurely, typically through interaction with a user interface.  The class
that "runs" an Integrator, repeatedly invoking its doStep method, is an example of an Activity.
<p>
Specific sequences of actions can be defined by extending <tt>ActivityGroupSeries</tt> (which
performs the tasks sequentially) or <tt>ActivityGroupParallel</tt> (which performs the tasks
simultaneously, on separate threads).  Traversal across a series of state points, for example
to perform a thermodynamic-integration calculation, could be suitably implemented as an 
ActivityGroupSeries.
<p>
The {@link etomica.action.activity.Controller Controller} is a special ActivityGroupSeries that loops through a mutable
list of Actions/Activities, performing each in turn.  Each Simulation has one Controller instance,
through which the simulation is conducted and other tasks are performed.
