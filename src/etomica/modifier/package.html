Provides classes that define adapters to permit modification of arbitrary fields in 
arbitrary classes.  The Modifier interface defines setValue and getValue methods, which
can be invoked by user-interface widgets or other classes that change values of fields
of other classes.  Classes implementing Modifier can define these methods as needed to
cause manipulation of specific values.
<p>
A class implementing Modifier is analogous to a "wire" that connects a knob
to something that it adjusts or changes.
