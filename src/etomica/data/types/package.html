Defines classes that encapsulate various types of data and enable casting between them.  The
encapsulating classes are subclasses of {@link etomica.data.Data Data}, which is the abstract type
that is transmitted from a {@link etomica.data.DataSource DataSource} to a {@link etomica.data.DataSink DataSink} through a data
processing stream, via the classes defined in the {@link etomica.data etomica.data} package.
<p>
The data held by a Data instance can be changed, and in this sense a Data object is mutable.
However, the <i>structure</i> of a Data object is immutable; it cannot be changed after construction.
The <i>structure</i> refers to the type and number of data values held by the Data object.  Simple
Data objects, such as DataDouble and DataInteger, hold a single data value, and have a trivial structure.
In contrast, a DataDouble array holds an array of <tt>double</tt> values; moreover this object can
be configured to look like a multidimensional array.  Its structure then refers to the shape of this
array -- the number of <tt>double</tt> values it holds, and in what arrangement.  It is this aspect
of the DataDoubleArray that cannot be changed after construction.
<p>
In addition to the data values, a Data object also holds a {@link etomica.data.DataInfo DataInfo} instance, which 
holds descriptive information about the encapsulated data.  The DataInfo held by a Data instance is
completely immutable -- the DataInfo instance cannot be changed, nor can the information it holds.
<p>
This package defines classes for casting between Data types.  These classes normally are constructed
by the <tt>getDataCaster</tt> method of a DataSink, which is invoked by a DataPipe (or similar class)
when the DataSink is added to it.  The caster is a DataProcessor that will copy the data 
(as completely as possible) to a new Data instance of the output Data type.  This ensures that the
DataSink receives a Data instance of the type it is expecting.
