Defines Monte Carlo trial moves that are used by the IntegratorMC class.  Subclasses
of MCMove perform specific trial moves that together define the statistical mechanical
ensemble and Monte Carlo algorithm used to sample atomic configurations.  The MCMove subclasses
provide appropriate information needed for IntegratorMC to calculate and apply acceptance
probabilities according to the Metropolis (or another) algorithm.
<p>
To use these classes, add instances of them to the governing instance of IntegratorMC.  With each
call to doStep, the Integrator selects one of the added MCMoves at random, performs the trial, 
and decides acceptance. The MCMove is notified of the outcome of the acceptance decision.
<p>
The likelihood of selection of a given MCMove (relative to the others added to the Integrator)
may be adjusted.
